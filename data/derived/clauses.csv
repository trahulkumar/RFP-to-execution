The previous movable barrier machine contract (DCKA-2020-B-0095) did not have a DBE requirement. b. The maintenance requirements of the movable barrier machine and barriers are usually performed by an operator and mechanic (with 10+ years of experience working the barrier machine) which makes it very difficult to find a DBE that can perform this type of specialized work. c. All parts for the movable barrier machine and barriers are sole sourced from Lindsay Transportation Solutions so parts and materials cannot be procured through a DBE supplier. DBE Goal has been waived. 2 Please provide specifications regarding the current security system (cameras, etc.) that is located at 2860 South Capitol Street SE. Does DDOT intend to repair the old system or install a brand-new system to monitor the movable barrier machine? Service no longer needed and has been removed from the solicitation. 3 Please clarify, if the contractor is only to replace the front and back fabric panel of the storage facility at 2860 South Capitol Street SE?

The District’s Next Gen automated traffic enforcement system will build on lessons learned and best practices, provide enhanced capabilities, and increased flexibility. As a supplement to traditional police traffic enforcement, the District of Columbia utilizes a range of automated safety enforcement tools to reduce dangerous traffic violations and improve safety for all road users. Survey after survey show strong public support for the use of photo enforcement systems to reduce crashes. Support for these technologies is strongest among families with children. The following automated enforcement applications are currently employed by the District: a. Automated Red-Light Enforcement: District of Columbia residents have identified unsafe driving— including running red lights and stop signs—as their number one public safety concern. To help combat the serious problem of red-light running, the District implemented its automated red-light enforcement program in August 1999. The program uses photo enforcement technology to enforce the law fairly and consistently, with the goal of reducing violations, preventing crashes and injuries, and saving lives. b. Automated Speed Enforcement: Photo radar is a proven tool in deterring speeding behavior and reducing associated collisions. Speed cameras have"

Speeding in the District of Columbia has been substantially reduced in the enforcement zones where photo radar has been deployed. c. Stop Signs: Drivers are required to come to a complete stop prior to the stop bar at an intersection controlled by a stop sign or traffic signal. This allows the driver to look around and ensure that he or she has the right of way before continuing. Automated Stop Sign Enforcement units use radar to detect if a vehicle has stopped at, rolled through, or ran a stop sign. Tickets are issued when vehicles fail to come to a complete stop. d. Oversized Vehicles: Many residential streets were not built to handle commercial vehicles. The enforcement of restricted truck and bus routes reduces infrastructure damage and enhances quality of life. Truck and bus drivers must stay on designated commercial motor vehicle routes and not drive on restricted streets. Oversize units use radar and lasers to detect whether a vehicle is too large to drive legally on a residential street. e. Bus/Bike/Curbside: This is a push in many urban cities to have dedicated bus and bike lanes. The ability to keep these lanes clear is vital to improving and increasing the efficiency of bus and bike travel. This will increase bus and bike usage since it will be a more defendable form of timely transportation. Thi s will also impact WMATA the largest bus provider in the District as well as the DDOT owne"

A. Vendors for specific scope items such as vibration testing, electrical testing, access equipment, and traffic control service do not need to be included with the initial proposal submission. These vendors can be identified and provided at the time work order proposals are solicited and work order schedules are established. This approach allows for greater flexibility in aligning vendor capabilities with the specific technical requirements and timing of each work order."

Section C3.3 says the Inspection Team Leader key staff position is the person on-site who oversees the tunnel inspection team. Can you confirm the key staff position that is needed to be on-site and the amount of time this person needs to be on-site each week. A. In response to your question, sorry an error was made in response to your question #4. The project manager is not the on-site field engineer. The on-site field engineer is the inspection team leader. A resume is needed for the inspection team leader. Regarding the time commitment, the inspection team leader is expected to be on-site to manage and supervise inspection activities. This typically equates to a minimum of 40 hours per week when inspections are occurring, though this depends on the inspection schedule and scope of work. The offeror must be prepared to ensure that this individual is present on-site to meet project demands and maintain quality oversight."

The last paragraph seems to be contradictory “No work that impacts the flow of traffic may be performed outside of 9:30 AM to 3:30 PM. Question: As long as two- way single lane traffic is maintained (on secondary roadways) and barriers as described are used, will 7 AM to 7 PM work hours be allowed as stated? Overly restrictive work hours will greatly reduce production and overall costs to this contract. Could DCDOT please better clarify the intended work hours on this contract, so we can generate the most cost-efficient pricing.

The requirements are urgent, and the contract’s anticipated term is for a base period and four potential one-year option periods. A shortened advertisement period of fourteen days will be required in order to meet DMPED’s service target for compliance with the legislative initiative. The timing of the original solicitation allowed continuity in tasks, specifically the joint Environmental Assessment and Master Plan. With the completion of the first phase of the joint EA/Master Plan this month, a shortened solicitation will allow for continuity in services required to support the second phase. A solicitation longer than two weeks risks a delay in the work required to complete the transfer of Poplar Point to the District and eventual redevelopment of the site."

The Poplar Point Project (the “Project”) is comprised of the steps required to transfer approximately 110 acres presently owned by the United States Government and under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park Service (NPS) to the District of Columbia as stipulated in the Federal and District of Columbia Real Property Act of 2006 (the “Act”). The Project will include tasks to satisfy requirements as detailed under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (“NEPA”) to aid decision making under Title III of the Act.

Additionally, these new program components require a higher degree of security audit compliance than was specified in the solicitation Changes to Youth Work Permits—The Youth Work Permit Modernization Act, introduced in March 2024, expands permit eligibility. This soon-to-be-enacted law requires a tracking mechanism and compliance reporting that was not included in the YPMS solicitation. The scope must include automating this program.

Professional Liability Insurance (Errors & Omissions) We respectfully request a waiver of the Professional Liability Insurance requirement outlined in the section mentioned above of the insurance provisions. As this is a construction contract and not a design or professional services agreement, we believe the requirement for professional liability coverage — which typically addresses errors and omissions in professional design or consulting work — does not apply to the scope of work contemplated. Our work does not involve design, engineering, or architectural services, and thus, we do not perform activities that would ordinarily expose us to professional liability risks. We do carry comprehensive general liability, automobile, and workers’ compensation insurance, in accordance with industry standards and all other contract requirements. We kindly ask that the professional liability insurance requirement be waived or removed from the final contract. Please let us know if any additional documentation is needed to support this request. We appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your favorable consideration. Answer 1: the insurance can not be adjusted at this time. Question 2: I.8 INSURANCE E. DURATION.

The requirement to maintain insurance coverage for ten (10) years post-completion appears to be appropriate for vertical construction projects such as office buildings, residential structures, or high-rise developments. However, this project primarily involves underground utility work, which typically carries a different risk profile and does not involve above-ground structures with long-term occupancy or use. Given the nature of the work, we respectfully request that the post-completion insurance coverage duration be reduced from ten (10) years to two (2) years, which is more consistent with industry standards for similar scopes of work. Answer 2: The insurance can not be adjusted at this time.
